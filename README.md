# Rainbow Delimiters
<strong>A web browser plugin to colorize the matched brackets of source code on HTML pages of your browser</strong>, it is especially useful for viewing source code of a Lisp-family dialect language.


* Because of its trying to be analogous of Emacs's [rainbow-delimiters-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RainbowDelimiters) in some way, this package is straightly named "Rainbow Delimiters".
* Mostly You would notice that this plugin is very useful as you are going through a code file of one repo from a website like github.com or checking a piece of source code of someone's answer from stackoverflow.com.
* For using it within HTML pages generated by Racket Scribble/Frog such as <https://docs.racket-lang.org>, you may as well check <https://github.com/yanyingwang/scribble-rainbow-delimiters>.
